Performanxce:
-iphone pro max =14 lettter*1000(people)=140000
-with debouncing 3 API CALLS *1000=3000


Debouncing with 200ms

-if difference between 2 key strokes <200ms-DECLINE API CALL

-200ms make an API call



cache:


    time complexity to search in array=O(n)
    time complexity in object =O(1)

    bcz we iterate on every element.we do linear search

    *some people use array methods
    like 
    array.indexOf()
    array.includes()

[i,ip,iph,iphone]

{
    i:
    ip:
    iph:
    iphone:
}

we also use newMap();
it is more optimized to search in array.
